FORMAT
========================
Please aggregate and summarize this data into structured paragraphs (as few as possible, as many as necessary). The output SHOULD ALWAYS follow the format below:

- *Type*: Whether the paragraph is related to a "sector" or a "component"
- *Subtype*: Provides the name of the sector or of the component to which the paragraph refers.
- *Excerpts ID*: Identify the ids of the excerpts you took into account for creating the summary.
- *Content*: A short summary aggregating findings related to the Subtype, so that they are supported by evidence coming from more than one report, and there is ONLY ONE entry per subtype. Always integrate in the paragraph evidence that supports it from the data available from multiples reports or items, include year and country of the evidence. The length of each paragraph MUST be between 20 and 30 words.

Important:
- ONLY create one summary per subtype
- DO NOT mention the ids of the excerpts in the content of the summary.
- DO NOT use data from any source other than the one provided.
